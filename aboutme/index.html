    <P>Hello everyone, here's a quick introduction of myself. I'm married to my amazing wife and we have a wonderful goldendoodle. I'm originally
        from Arizona and lived there the majority of my life. I currently work as a graphic designer and I'm looking forward to finishing my Data Science degree to further 
        my professional career in tech with a desire to get into database construction and management.</P>

        <p> I'm really looking forward to this course as I wish to learn more about web development so that I can learn how to create my designs instead of relying on a developer.
            I've taken a few online courses on HTML and CSS, however I never stuck with it. While my degree and focus is more on back end development, I am very interested in 
            front end and I think this course is a good place to start really learning. 
        </p>

        <P>When I'm not working, I enjoy playing computer games, running, reading, weight lifting, and wrestling when I have the time. I really enjoy 
            learning different things, so I tend to pick a new skill every few months to start learning about. Luckily this habit was what allowed me to switch career fields
            when I wanted to. I also enjoy watching documentaries and videos about random topics just to learn a little about the world. </P>

        <p> I'm looking forward to learning how to create beautiful web pages and I'm excited to grow both professionally and spiritually through this process! Thank you for taking
            the time to look at my page! </p>
    </P>
