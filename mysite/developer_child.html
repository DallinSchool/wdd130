                <p>Data in the modern world is what gold was in the old. A business must not only understand the best practices of storing and safeguarding data, 
                    but also the best ways of manipulating and understanding that data. I can write complex queries to gain key information, build database dashboards to 
                    display the information to users, as well as create, update, and delete information. Database optimization is very important to me, so I enjoy finding 
                    inefficient methods of storage and developing more efficient ways to get the job done. </p>

                <div class="hover-text">Task Automation</div>
                <p>Scaling in a tech company is a must, and automation is one of the best ways to do that. Any business is going to have a multitude of manual tasks that 
                    can be automated. I enjoy finding these tasks and then writing Python scripts that make processes more efficient and automate what can be automated. For 
                    example, I have written several scripts that pull data from the database in the form of a csv, update the csv by comparing it to a different csv, then 
                    upload the new data back to the database. I then created a system that will run those specific scripts at specific times during the day, removing the need 
                    for any human interaction. This has saved me countless hours of manual data entry work and saved my employer considerable funds. This allows the business 
                    to scale and focus on larger problems.

                <div class="hover-text">Plugin Development</div>
                <p>My primary experience in Javascript development is that of creating plugins for various softwares to make those softwares more efficient. For example, 
                    I have created many Figma plugins that make my design process much faster. Instead of manually changing "Label" layer names on my interactive maps, I 
                    can automatically target and change them with my "Label2Name" plugin. I use to have to manually click on an element and select "Rename", but now with my 
                    "Click2Name" plugin, I simply have to input a name, indicate if I want to add a numeric in sequential order, and then click one time on each element in 
                    the order I wish to name them.
