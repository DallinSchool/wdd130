      <p>
        Welcome to my website! I'm Dallin Hale, a 29-year-old web developer that transitioned from serving as a police officer
        to thriving in the tech industry. I currently specialize in developing interactive maps for a space reservation software company, but I also
        design web elements, create useful plugins and scripts, and manage and manipulate databases. I have 4 years experience as a full-time graphic designer, and during
        that time I also learned SQL, Python, Javascript, and a bit of Typescript. <br>
        
        <br> Explore my work to see how I can bring creativity and precision to your products.

      <h3>Graphic Design</h3>
      <p>
        Applications can use a variety of different designs, however one that I have grown to enjoy making is interactive maps.
        This design showcases an interactive map I built of one of the BYU-I buildings for a software called Tactic. Instructors would be able to display office
        hours and allow students to make appointments, classrooms would display class times, and conference rooms can be booked (and others invited to the meeting).
        I'v made hundreds, if not thousands of similar maps.
      </p>

      <p>I have some experience in designing for objects that won’t be rendered with code, but instead manufactured and shipped to clients. This is an NFC/QR chip 
        I designed, which allows users to reserve a seat in person when they swipe it with their phone or scan the QR. We order thousands of these stickers, which 
        are 2x2 inch in size. They can be placed next to anything that you want to reserve or display information about that thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a design flow that shows a few different models of the mobile application I helped design. Each button, icon, piece of text, and menu was created by me.
        This specific workflow shows the user experience from first appearing on the dashboard, then going to the live map view, and then selecting and reserving a resource.
        Whether it’s creating designs for an entire application, or just creating a new series of buttons, I can do it. 
        </p>
      <p>
        Documentation is a key part of any business. Whether it’s internal documents that explains how a business operates to new employees, or external documentation
        that explains to a customer how they can use a product, it’s vital to the smooth operation of any business. I enjoy creating both internal and external documentation, 
        making it quick and easy to digest information. Here is an example of some documentation I created that we send to new customers.

      <h3>Coding & Database</h3>
      <p>
        Data in the modern world is what gold was in the old. A business must not only understand the best practices of storing and safeguarding data, but also the best
        ways of manipulating and understanding that data. I can write complex queries to gain key information, build database dashboards to display the information to users, 
        as well as create, update, and delete information. Database optimization is very important to me, so I enjoy finding inefficient methods of storage and developing more 
        efficient ways to get the job done. 
      </p>
      Scaling in a tech company is a must, and automation is one of the best ways to do that. Any business is going to have a multitude of manual tasks that can be automated. 
      I enjoy finding these tasks and then writing Python scripts that make processes more efficient and automate what can be automated. For example, I have written several 
      scripts that pull data from the database in the form of a csv, update the csv by comparing it to a different csv, then upload the new data back to the database. I then 
      created a system that will run those specific scripts at specific times during the day, removing the need for any human interaction. This has saved me countless hours of 
      manual data entry work and saved my employer considerable funds. This allows the business to scale and focus on larger problems.
      <p>
        My primary experience in Javascript development is that of creating plugins for various softwares to make those softwares more efficient. For example, I have created 
        many Figma plugins that make my design process much faster. Instead of manually changing "Label" layer names on my interactive maps, I can automatically target and 
        change them with my "Label2Name" plugin. I use to have to manually click on an element and select "Rename", but now with my "Click2Name" plugin, I simply have to input 
        a name, indicate if I want to add a numeric in sequential order, and then click one time on each element in the order I wish to name them.
