      <p>
        Welcome to my website! I'm Dallin Hale, a 29-year-old web developer that transitioned from serving as a police officer
        to thriving in the tech industry. I currently specialize in developing interactive maps for a space reservation software company, but I also
        design web elements, create useful plugins and scripts, and manage and manipulate databases. I have 4 years experience as a full-time graphic designer, and during
        that time I also learned SQL, Python, Javascript, and a bit of Typescript. <br>
        
        <br> Explore my work to see how I can bring creativity and precision to your products.

      <h3>Graphic Design</h3>
      <p>
        This page will show 4 examples of projects or types of projects that I have designed in the past. This will include an interactive map, a NFC/QR code sticker design,
        mobile application designs, and customer-facing documentation. Each project will have a picture and an explination underneath it.

      <h3>Coding & Database</h3>
      <p>
        This page will talk about 3 skills that I have experience in when it comes to developing with code and databases. These skills are creating automation scripts using 
        pythin, creating application plugins such as Figma plugins with Javascript, and knowledge in manipulating databases. Each skill has an image, and then text will be under
        each of those images explaining in more detail.
